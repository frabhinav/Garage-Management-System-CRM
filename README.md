## Garage Management System - Amount Distribution Use Case

This project implements a use case for distributing service amounts dynamically based on the services selected by a customer for their vehicle. The logic is built using Salesforce Apex classes and triggers.

## üìù Use Case Description

The *Amount Distribution Use Case* calculates the total amount for each service combination chosen by the customer. The service types include:

- *Maintenance Service*
- *Repairs*
- *Replacement Parts*

The calculation is handled by an Apex class and executed via a trigger on the Appointment__c object.

## üõ† Functionality

### Apex Class: AmountDistributionHandler
This class contains the logic for determining the service amount. It evaluates combinations of the following fields in the Appointment__c object:
- Maintenance_service__c
- Repairs__c
- Replacement_Parts__c

Based on the selected services, it assigns the calculated value to the Service_Amount__c field.
